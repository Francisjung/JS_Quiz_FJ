        # Assignment 4: JS Quiz

## Description

- This project was created to as a way for bootcamp students to study the basics of JavaScript.
- This project aims to provide bootcamp students with a series of questions which will test their knowledge of JavaScript, telling them which questions they got correct and which ones they got wrong.
- Scores are then recorded and posted on a a locally stored leaderboard, allowing students to challenge themselves and try to beat either their own previous scores or other students on the same machine.
- Working on this project helped me to become more familiar with the Document Object Model (DOM for short), as well as practice wha tI already knew about JS, HTML, and CSS. I found this project to be a bit more intimidating than some of the previous projects, but I am happy that I was able to get it done in the end. I was not able to complete the css to the degree I wanted to, but I will take this as a lesson in time management.

## Credits

This project was made partly in collaboration with my fellow student Kyle McClendon (https://github.com/KyleM021199), and with some help from the amazing tutorials and documentation at (https://w3schools.com).

Thanks to their help I was able to save myself a sleepless night and a few cups of coffee, I couldn't be more grateful!
